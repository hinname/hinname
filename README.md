### Hello friend!  I'm Herivelton Costa


<!--

I love programming because resolving problems with technology is amazing. <br>
I'm based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Since 2017 studying programming, during my high school, I started with Pascal and Python. Now I'm focusing on Javascript.

I'm always trying to learn something new, even if it's not directly related to programming, like Marketing or Bussiness in general.

### What I'm focusing on üë®‚Äçüíªüíª
I'm learning the concepts about Web development such as API REST and SPA.

‚ö° Fun fact: I love games and books. I'm studying game development in my free times.
